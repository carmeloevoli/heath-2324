\section{Particle Acceleration in Shocks and Energy Budget}

Consider a shock with a generic Mach number $\mathcal M$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate the spectrum of particles energised at the shock assuming that there is no injection at the shock but that there are particles at upstream infinity with a given spectrum $f(p)=K_p^{-\alpha}$, for $p>p_0$.
What happens to the spectrum of accelerated particles as a function of $\mathcal M$ and $\alpha$?
\item Assuming $\mathcal M\gg 1$ (strong shock) and $\alpha=4.7$ (similar to the spectrum of Galactic Cosmic Rays) and that there are only protons in the system, calculate the ratio between the total energy in the initial spectrum $f(p)$ and the total energy in the accelerated particles at the shock location. What does the ratio of the two depend upon?
\end{itemize}
