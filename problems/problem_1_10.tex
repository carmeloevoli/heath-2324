\section{Threshold of Anti-proton secondary production}

Determine the minimum kinetic energy required by a proton to produce an anti-proton upon colliding with another proton at rest. Consider the principle of baryon number conservation, which necessitates that anti-proton production in proton-proton (pp) collisions must occur via the reaction \( pp \rightarrow ppp\bar p \).
