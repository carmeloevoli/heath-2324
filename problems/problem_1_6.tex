\section{Constraints on the ExtraGalactic Background Light from very-high-energy observations of blazars}

The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is a significant factor in the absorption of $\gamma$-rays from distant astronomical objects, such as blazars, through the mechanism of pair production. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Utilize observations of $\gamma$-rays with energies $E_\gamma \sim$~TeV from a blazar at a given redshift to outline a method to determine a conservative upper limit for the average EBL intensity as a function of $z$. Assume that $dt/dz$ can be approximated by $H_0^{-1}$, and that all EBL photons have the energy where the pair-production cross section is maximized (monochromatic approximation).
\end{itemize}
