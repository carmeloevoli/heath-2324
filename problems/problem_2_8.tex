\section{Analysis of Maximum Momentum and Growth Rate of Streaming Instability in a Plane Parallel Shock Front}

Consider a plane parallel shock front moving at speed \( v_s=5000 \) km/s and assume that there is a
free escape boundary condition at a distance \( x_0 = 1 \) pc upstream of the shock. The density of particles upstream is of 1 particle per cc and the magnetic field is \( B_0=6 \) microGauss. The
temperature upstream in \( T=10^4 \) K. The diffusion coefficient is assumed to be Bohm. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate the value of the maximum momentum. 
\item At this point calculate the growth rate of the streaming instability assuming an efficiency of particle acceleration (in terms of fraction of the ram pressure) of 10\%. \emph{Hint: Use the argument of momentum conservation applied in the case CR streams faster than Alfven speed to evaluate the growth rate (Kulsrud \& Pearce, 1969).}
\item Compare the corresponding time scale (1 over the growth rate) with the acceleration time derived using the Bohm diffusion coefficient.
\end{itemize}
