\section{Spectrum Calculation and Boundary Conditions in Planar Shock with Free Escape Surface}

Let us consider a planar shock with compression factor $r$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate the spectrum of particles (protons) accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration assuming that in the downstream region (the upstream extends to infinity) there is a surface of free escape, namely a surface where the distribution function vanishes, at distance $z_0$ from the shock surface. 

\item Comment on the physical meaning of the result and of the free streaming assumption. 

\item What would it mean,
physically, to require that $df/dz=0$ at $z=z_0$ instead of the free streaming? Would it be possible to
find a stationary solution then?
\end{itemize}
