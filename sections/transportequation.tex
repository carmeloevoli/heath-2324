\section{The Advection-Diffusion Equation}

Consider a beam of particles with a distribution of pitch angles propagating through a plasma characterized by a spectrum of Alfvén waves. The goal is to understand the evolution of this beam under the influence of resonant interactions, as previously introduced. The resulting transport equation will connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic particle dynamics, bridging microphysics and macrophysics.

The central quantity in this analysis is the \emph{phase-space density}, \( f = f(\vb{x}, \vb{p}, t) \), defined such that the number of particles \( dN \) at time \( t \) in a given phase-space volume element is:
\[
f \equiv \frac{dN}{d^3 \vb{x} \, d^3 \vb{p}}.
\]

Notably, \( f \) is a relativistic invariant, since both the number of particles \( dN \) and the phase-space volume element \( d^3 \vb{x} \, d^3 \vb{p} \) are relativistically invariant.

To simplify the analysis, we make the following assumptions:
\[
f(\vb{x}, \vb{p}, t) \rightarrow f(z, \mu, t),
\]
where the motion of particles is predominantly along the \( z \)-axis, the Alfvén waves are stationary, preserving the magnitude of the particle momentum, \( |p| \), and we assume azimuthal symmetry around the \( z \)-axis reducing the angular dependence to \( \mu \), the cosine of the pitch angle.

\subsection{The Diffusion Equation in Pitch Angle}

Our objective is to describe the evolution of the phase-space density \( f \) over a small time interval \( \Delta t \). To model the effect of pitch-angle scattering, we introduce the \emph{transition probability density} \( \Psi(\mu, \Delta\mu) \), which represents the likelihood of a particle experiencing a pitch-angle change \( \Delta\mu \) during \( \Delta t \). This probability density satisfies the normalization condition:
\begin{equation}
\int \Psi(\mu, \Delta\mu) \, d\Delta\mu = 1, \quad \forall \mu.
\end{equation}

The phase-space density at time \( t + \Delta t \) can then be expressed as an integral over all possible pitch-angle variations \( \Delta\mu \), accounting for the contribution of particles that scattered into the pitch angle \( \mu \). The evolution equation is given by:
\begin{equation}
f(z + v\mu \Delta t, \mu, t + \Delta t) = \int d\Delta\mu \, f(z, \mu - \Delta\mu, t) \Psi(\mu - \Delta\mu, \Delta\mu),
\end{equation}

Assuming small variations in \( \mu \), we apply perturbation theory and perform a second-order Taylor expansion for both sides of the equation.

For the left-hand side, expanding \( f(z + v \mu \Delta t, \mu, t + \Delta t) \) yields:
\begin{equation}
f(z + v \mu \Delta t, \mu, t + \Delta t) = f + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} v \mu \Delta t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \Delta t.
\end{equation}

For the right-hand side, we expand each term:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Expanding \( f(z, \mu - \Delta \mu, t) \):
\begin{equation}
f(z, \mu - \Delta \mu, t) = f - \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \Delta \mu + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \mu^2} (\Delta \mu)^2.
\end{equation}

\item Expanding \( \Psi(\mu - \Delta \mu, \Delta \mu) \):
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\mu - \Delta \mu, \Delta \mu) = \Psi - \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \mu} \Delta \mu + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial \mu^2} (\Delta \mu)^2.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

Substituting these expansions into equation~\eqref{eq:distribpert} and keeping terms up to second order in \( \Delta \mu \), we have:
\begin{equation}
f + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \Delta t + v \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \Delta t = 
\int d\Delta \mu \left[ 
f \Psi 
- \frac{\partial (f \Psi)}{\partial \mu} \Delta \mu 
+ \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 (f \Psi)}{\partial \mu^2} (\Delta \mu)^2
\right].
\end{equation}

To proceed, we introduce the moments of the transition probability density \( \Psi \), which encode the statistical properties of pitch-angle scattering:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The first moment of \( \Psi \), representing the expectation value of the pitch-angle change \( \Delta \mu \), is given by:
\[
\int d\Delta \mu \, \Delta \mu \, \Psi(\mu, \Delta \mu) = \langle \Delta \mu \rangle.
\]
\item The second moment, quantifying the variance of \( \Delta \mu \), is:
\[
\int d\Delta \mu \, (\Delta \mu)^2 \, \Psi(\mu, \Delta \mu) = \langle (\Delta \mu)^2 \rangle.
\]
\end{itemize}

Substituting the first and second moments into the expanded integral equation~\eqref{eq:distribpert} and simplifying (keeping into account that  \( f \) does not depend on \( \Delta \mu \)), we obtain the following differential equation for \( f \):
%
\begin{equation}
\cancel{f} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \Delta t + v \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \Delta t = 
\cancel{f} -\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left( f \langle \Delta \mu \rangle \right) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \mu^2} \left( f \langle (\Delta \mu)^2 \rangle \right).
\end{equation}

To proceed, we incorporate the principle of \emph{detailed balance}, which applies symmetry constraints to the transition probability distribution \( \Psi \). 
%
Specifically, detailed balance implies:
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\mu, -\Delta \mu) = \Psi(\mu - \Delta \mu, \Delta \mu)~.
\end{equation}
%
This symmetry ensures that the probability of a particle scattering from \( \mu \) to \( \mu - \Delta \mu \) is equal to the reverse process. 

By Taylor expanding \( \Psi(\mu - \Delta \mu, \Delta \mu) \) about \( \mu \), we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\mu - \Delta \mu, \Delta \mu) = \Psi(\mu, \Delta \mu) - \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \mu} \Delta \mu + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial \mu^2} (\Delta \mu)^2 + \mathcal O(\Delta \mu^3)~.
\end{equation}

Notice that using the normalization condition for \( \Psi \), equation~\eqref{eq:normpsi}, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\int d\Delta \mu \Psi(\mu, -\Delta \mu) - \int d\Delta \mu \Psi(\mu, \Delta \mu) = 0~.
\end{equation}

Substituting the expanded expression for \( \Psi(\mu, -\Delta \mu) \) and using~, we arrive at:
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left( \int d\Delta \mu \Psi \Delta \mu \right) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \mu^2} \left( \int d\Delta \mu \Psi (\Delta \mu)^2 \right) = 0.
\end{equation}

Thus, the above equation can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left[ \langle \Delta \mu \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial \langle (\Delta \mu)^2 \rangle}{\partial \mu} \right] = 0~.
\end{equation}

The above equation implies that the quantity \( \langle \Delta \mu \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial  \langle (\Delta \mu)^2 \rangle}{\partial \mu} \) is independent of \( \mu \), i.e., it is a \emph{constant} with respect to \( \mu \). 

{\color{red}ASSUME THIS IS 0}

Substituting the result \( \mathcal{A} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial \mathcal{B}}{\partial \mu} = 0 \) back into equation~\eqref{eq:fwithawithb}, we find:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \Delta t  +  v \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \Delta t = 
\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left[ \langle (\Delta \mu)^2 \rangle \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \right].
\end{equation}

To interpret this equation, we define the \emph{pitch angle diffusion coefficient} \( D_{\mu\mu} \), which characterizes the rate of pitch angle scattering. It is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
D_{\mu\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{2} \left\langle \frac{\Delta \mu \Delta \mu}{\Delta t} \right\rangle.
\end{equation}

Substituting \( D_{\mu\mu} \) into the equation and dividing through by \( \Delta t \), we obtain:
\begin{remark}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + v \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left[ D_{\mu\mu} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \right].
\end{equation}
\end{remark}

This equation, known as the \emph{Fokker-Planck equation}, describes the evolution of the particle distribution \( f \) due to pitch angle diffusion. It balances the effects of advection (motion along \( z \)) and pitch angle scattering, which redistributes particles in \( \mu \).

The term \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left[ D_{\mu\mu} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \right] \) represents the diffusive spreading of the particle distribution in pitch angle \( \mu \). This \emph{collision term} arises from interactions between particles and Alfvén waves, where random scattering events drive the system toward isotropy.
%
For that reason, \( D_{\mu\mu} \) depends on the wave spectrum and the particle momentum, in particular, for a background of Alfvén waves, \( D_{\mu\mu} \) can be shown to be proportional to \( (1 - \mu^2) F(k, p) \), where \( F(k, p) \) encodes the wave-particle resonance condition. 

Over time, pitch angle scattering leads to \emph{isotropization} of the particle distribution in the reference frame of the Alfvén waves. However, a slight residual anisotropy remains, determined by the Alfvén speed \( v_A \), which is much smaller than the speed of light \( c \). The resulting anisotropy is proportional to the ratio \( v_A / c \).

% The derived Fokker-Planck equation provides a foundation for understanding particle transport in astrophysical plasmas. The diffusion coefficient \( D_{\mu\mu} \) bridges microscopic wave-particle interactions with macroscopic transport processes. By extending this framework, one can analyze spatial diffusion, energy exchange, and the broader impact of magnetic turbulence on cosmic ray propagation.

\subsection{The Diffusion Equation in Space}

As discussed in the previous section, after prolonged scattering, the phase-space distribution \( f \) becomes nearly isotropic. To account for the slight anisotropy, we write:
\begin{equation}
f = M + f_1 \mu~,
\end{equation}
where \( M \) is the isotropic component, which dominates, and \( f_1 \mu \) represents the dipole anisotropy, reflecting the residual directional dependence introduced by the wave-particle dynamics.

Now, we transition from pitch angle diffusion to spatial diffusion. For this, we assume \( f \) is only weakly dependent on the pitch angle \( \mu \). In fact, the observed anisotropy of cosmic rays is remarkably small (\( \sim 10^{-4} \) at all energies), reinforcing the dominance of the isotropic term \( M \).

To move from pitch angle dependence to spatial diffusion, we apply the operator \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \) to all terms in equation~\eqref{eq:fdiffmu}. Simultaneously, we introduce the definition of \( M \) as:
\begin{equation}
M = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, f(\mu),
\end{equation}
which extracts the isotropic component of \( f \). If \( f \) is perfectly isotropic, \( M \) reduces to \( f \).

Applying \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \) to equation~\eqref{eq:fdiffmu}, we find:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} + \frac{v}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu f = \left[ D_{\mu\mu} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \right]_{-1}^1.
\end{equation}

The term \( \left[ D_{\mu\mu} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \right]_{-1}^1 \) vanishes because \( D_{\mu\mu} \propto (1 - \mu^2) \), which is zero at \( \mu = \pm 1 \).
Moreover, as \( f \) becomes isotropic, \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \to 0 \).

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial J}{\partial z} = 0,
\end{equation}
where we define the \emph{particle flux} (or current) \( J \) as:
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, v \mu f.
\end{equation}

The pitch angle scattering drives the system toward isotropy, with any remaining anisotropy contributing to the flux \( J \).

To calculate \( J \), we use the decomposition \( f = M + f_1 \mu \). Substituting this into the definition of \( J \), we find:
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{v}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu \left(M + f_1 \mu\right).
\end{equation}

The term involving \( M \) vanishes because:
\begin{equation}
\int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu = 0.
\end{equation}

Thus, \( J \) reduces to:
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{v}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu^2 f_1.
\end{equation}

Since \( f_1 \ll M \), the flux \( J \) is much smaller than \( v M \). We now turn to a more explicit expression for \( f_1 \) by leveraging the anisotropic term in equation~\eqref{eq:fdiffmu}.

From equation~\eqref{eq:fdiffmu}, we find that \( f_1 \) satisfies:
\begin{equation}
(1 - \mu^2) \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} = \frac{1 - \mu^2}{D_{\mu\mu}} \left[\frac{\partial M}{\partial t}(1 + \mu) + v \frac{\partial M}{\partial z} \frac{1}{2} (\mu^2 - 1)\right].
\end{equation}

Integrating over \( \mu \), we relate the particle flux \( J \) to spatial and temporal gradients of \( M \). This yields:
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{v}{4} \frac{\partial M}{\partial t} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \frac{(1 - \mu^2)(1 + \mu)}{D_{\mu\mu}} - \frac{v^2}{8} \frac{\partial M}{\partial z} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \frac{(1 - \mu^2)^2}{D_{\mu\mu}}~,
\end{equation}
%
which we can rewrite in terms of the \emph{temporal} and \emph{spatial} diffusion coefficients as:
%
\begin{equation}
J = K_t \frac{\partial M}{\partial t} - K_z \frac{\partial M}{\partial z}
\end{equation}

We can estimate the magnitudes of the terms in the diffusion equation.

For the temporal diffusion coefficient \( K_t \):
\[
K_t \equiv \frac{v}{4} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \frac{(1 - \mu^2)(1 + \mu)}{D_{\mu\mu}} \, \rightarrow \, K_t \frac{\partial J}{\partial z}\sim \frac{v}{D_{\mu\mu}}\frac{J}{z}
\]

While, for the spatial diffusion coefficient \( K_z \):
\[
K_z \equiv \frac{v^2}{8} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \frac{(1 - \mu^2)^2}{D_{\mu\mu}} \, \rightarrow \, K_z\frac{\partial M}{\partial z} \sim \frac{v}{D_{\mu\mu}}\frac{vM}{z}
\]

Based on the definition in equation~\eqref{eq:defj}, we can express the current \( J \) as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, v\mu f \simeq \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, v\mu (f_0 + \mu f_1) 
\end{equation}

Here, \( f_1 \ll f_0 = M \) due to the near-isotropic nature of the distribution function, allowing for a linear expansion.

This leads us to:
%
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{v}{2} \left[ f_0 \cancel{\int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu} + f_1 \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu^2 \right] \sim v f_1 \ll v M
\end{equation}

Since \( f_1 \) is much smaller than \( f_0 \), this implies that \( J \) is significantly smaller than \( vM \).

With these considerations, in good approximation, we can write an equation for the time evolution of the isotropic component of the distribution function, \( M \), as:
%
\begin{remark}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} \simeq \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left[K_z \frac{\partial M}{\partial z}  \right]
\end{equation}
\end{remark}

The equation we have derived is a classic \emph{diffusion equation}, where \( K_z \) acts as the spatial diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient \( K_z \) is intricately linked to the probability distribution function \( \Psi \). By understanding \( \Psi \), one can deduce \( K_z \), thereby establishing a connection between microphysical interactions and their macroscopic implications.

In this context, the diffusive flux \( J \) is expressed as \( J = -K_z \frac{\partial M}{\partial z} \). This formulation allows us to compute the current from the distribution function \( M \), considering it as a first-order correction to the particle flux. 

This dynamic emerges from the somewhat nature of the function \( f \). It's the gradient of \( f \) that generates a net current, driving the evolution of the isotropic component \( M \) over time. The gradient effectively causes a net transport of particles, leading to smooth out the distribution \( M \) in response to spatial inhomogeneities, reflecting typical diffusive behavior.

%\end{remark}
%
%We have formulated a Fokker-Planck equation that characterizes the distribution's pitch angle diffusion over time, influenced by Alfvén waves present in the plasma. This equation exemplifies typical diffusive processes, where the variance of the distribution increases proportionally with time.
%
%Crucially, the term \( D_{\mu\mu} \) in the equation represents a form of \emph{collision} term. However, unlike conventional collisions involving atoms, this term describes the effect of scattering due to Alfvén waves. 
%
%The diffusion coefficient \( D_{\mu\mu} \), encapsulating the microphysical interactions, is computed for a background of Alfvén waves and is proportional to \( (1-\mu^2) F(k, p) \). This formula reflects the nuanced interplay between the pitch angle \( \mu \) and the wave-particle dynamics.
%
%Given this dynamic, we expect the particle distribution to become isotropic over time, especially in the reference frame of the Alfvén waves. This isotropization signifies a uniform distribution of particle velocities in all directions, relative to the wave frame.
%
%To transition from pitch angle diffusion to spatial diffusion, we consider the inherent nature of diffusive processes, which strive to make any system as isotropic as possible. In the context of Alfvén waves, this isotropization leads to a residual anisotropy proportional to the ratio of the Alfvén speed (\( v_A \)) to the speed of light (\( c \)). This outcome illustrates the profound impact of diffusion in a plasma, where cosmic rays, typically near light-speed, collectively move at the slower Alfvén speed.
%
%After establishing diffusion, we assume the distribution \( f \) in phase space becomes isotropic, with a slight anisotropy represented as:
%%
%\[
%f = M + f_1 \mu
%\]
%
%Here, \( f_1 \mu \) corresponds to the anisotropy, a dipole effect induced by the motion of the Alfvén waves relative to the observer's frame of reference. This anisotropy is a subtle yet significant manifestation of the dynamic interaction between particles and the wave environment in a plasma.

%\subsection{The Diffusion Equation in Space}
%
%As we discussed in the previous section, after prolonged scattering, the phase-space distribution \( f \) becomes nearly isotropic. To account for the slight anisotropy, we write \( f \) as:
%\[
%f = M + f_1 \mu,
%\]
%where:
%- \( M \) is the isotropic component, which dominates.
%- \( f_1 \mu \) represents the dipole anisotropy, reflecting the residual directional dependence introduced by the wave-particle dynamics.
%
%
%Now, we shift our focus from pitch angle diffusion to spatial diffusion. We consider the case where the function \( f \) is only weakly dependent on the pitch angle \(\mu\). In fact, we found that such a distribution is expected to become \emph{isotropized} by the scattering with waves, moreover the anisotropy observed in cosmic rays is \( \sim 10^{-4} \) at all energies.
%
%To transition from pitch angle distribution to spatial diffusion, we apply the operator \(\frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^{1} d\mu\) to all terms of equation~\eqref{eq:fdiffmu}. We also introduce a new definition:
%%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:Mdef}
%M = \frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, f(\mu)
%\end{equation}
%
%Notice that if \( f \) remains constant with respect to \( \mu \), then \( M \) simplifies to \( f \) itself. Essentially, \( M \) extracts the isotropic component of \( f \).
%
%Upon applying this operator, we derive:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} +\frac{v}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu f= \left[ {D_{\mu\mu}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu}} \right]_{-1}^{1} \simeq 0
%\end{equation}
%
%This result emerges because the diffusion coefficient \( D_{\mu\mu} \) is proportional to \( (1-\mu^2) \). Moreover, as \( f \) becomes isotropic, the term \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \) tends towards zero as well. 
%
%Let's introduce a new term to represent the flux of particles (i.e., a current):
%%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:defj}
%\frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, v\mu f = J
%\end{equation}
%
%With this in mind, the evolution of \( M \) can be expressed as:
%%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:jmcont}
%\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial J}{\partial z} = 0
%\end{equation}
%
%This equation implies that changes in \( M \) over time are directly linked to the spatial gradients of the current, \( J \). In other words, \( M \) evolves over time only if there is a corresponding change in the current.
%
%Now, let's focus on the current \( J \) itself:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%J 
%= \frac{1}{2} v\int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, f\mu  
%= -\frac{v}{4}\int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, f\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu}(1-\mu^2) 
%\end{equation}
%%
%hence
%%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:jpartialmu}
%J = \cancel{\left[ -\frac{v}{4}(1-\mu^2)f \right]_{-1}^{+1}} + \frac{v}{4}\int_{-1}^{+1} d\mu \, (1-\mu^2) \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu}
%\end{equation}
%
%The equation leverages the identity \(\mu = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu}(1-\mu^2)\), a mathematical manipulation that simplifies the expression.
%
%By integrating this equation from \( -1 \) to \( \mu \), we get:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int_{-1}^{\mu} d\mu' f +\int_{-1}^{\mu} d\mu' v\mu' \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=D_{\mu\mu}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu}
%\end{equation}
%
%Multiplying this equation by \( \frac{1-\mu^2}{D_{\mu\mu}} \) and assuming that \( f \) is isotropic in all quantities where \( \mu \) does not appear explicitly, we obtain:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%(1-\mu^2)\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu}=\frac{1-\mu^2}{D_{\mu\mu}} \frac{\partial M}{\partial t}(1+\mu) + v\frac{\partial M}{\partial z}\frac{1}{2} (\mu^2-1)\frac{(1-\mu^2)}{D_{\mu\mu}}
%\end{equation}
%
%Further integrating this equation over \( \mu \), we derive:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\int_{-1}^{+1} d\mu (1-\mu^2)\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} =\frac{\partial M}{\partial t}\int_{-1}^{+1} d\mu \frac{(1-\mu^2)}{D_{\mu\mu}}(1+\mu) -\frac{1}{2}v\frac{\partial M}{\partial z}\int_{-1}^{+1} d\mu \frac{(1-\mu^2)^2}{D_{\mu\mu}}
%\end{equation}
%
%Using equation~\eqref{eq:jpartialmu}, we find the expression for the current \( J \):
%%
%\begin{equation}
%J = \frac{v}{4}\frac{\partial M}{\partial t}\int_{-1}^{+1} d\mu \frac{(1-\mu^2)}{D_{\mu\mu}}(1+\mu) -\frac{v^2}{8}\frac{\partial M}{\partial z}\int_{-1}^{+1} d\mu \frac{(1-\mu^2)^2}{D_{\mu\mu}}
%\end{equation}
%
%We introduce two new quantities, \( K_t \) and \( K_z \), defined as:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%K_t \equiv \frac{v}{4} \int_{-1}^{+1}d\mu \frac{(1-\mu^2)(1+\mu)}{D_{\mu\mu}} 
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:kzz}
%K_z \equiv \frac{v^2}{8}\int_{-1}^{+1} d\mu \frac{(1-\mu^2)^2}{D_{\mu\mu}}
%\end{equation}
%
%Finally, applying these to equation \eqref{eq:jmcont}, we reach the following conclusion:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left[ K_t\frac{\partial J}{\partial z} + K_z\frac{\partial M}{\partial z}  \right]
%\end{equation}
%
%%%%% END CGPT %%%%
%
%We can estimate the magnitudes of the terms in the diffusion equation:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%K_t \frac{\partial J}{\partial z}\sim \frac{v}{D_{\mu\mu}}\frac{J}{z}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%K_z\frac{\partial M}{\partial z} \sim \frac{v}{D_{\mu\mu}}\frac{vM}{z}
%\end{equation}
%
%Based on the definition in equation~\eqref{eq:defj}, we can express the current \( J \) as follows:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%J = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, v\mu f \simeq \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, v\mu (f_0 + \mu f_1) 
%\end{equation}
%
%Here, \( f_1 \ll f_0 = M \) due to the near-isotropic nature of the distribution function, allowing for a linear expansion.
%
%This leads us to:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%J = \frac{v}{2} \left[ f_0 \cancel{\int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu} + f_1 \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \, \mu^2 \right] \sim v f_1 \ll v M
%\end{equation}
%
%Since \( f_1 \) is much smaller than \( f_0 \), this implies that \( J \) is significantly smaller than \( vM \).
%
%With these considerations, in good approximation, we can write an equation for the time evolution of the isotropic component of the distribution function, \( M \), as:
%%
%\begin{remark}
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} \simeq \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left[K_z \frac{\partial M}{\partial z}  \right]
%\end{equation}
%\end{remark}
%
%The equation we have derived is a classic \emph{diffusion equation}, where \( K_z \), as defined earlier, acts as the spatial diffusion coefficient. This equation is determined by the diffusion coefficient \( K_z \), which is intricately linked to the probability distribution function \( \Psi \). By understanding \( \Psi \), one can deduce \( K_z \), thereby establishing a connection between microphysical interactions and their macroscopic implications.
%
%In this context, the diffusive flux \( J \) is expressed as \( J = -K_z \frac{\partial M}{\partial z} \). This formulation allows us to compute the current from the distribution function \( M \), considering it as a first-order correction to the particle flux. 
%
%This dynamic emerges from the somewhat inhomogeneous nature of the function \( f \). It's the gradient of \( f \) that generates a net current, driving the evolution of the isotropic component \( M \) over time. The gradient effectively causes a net transport of particles, leading to changes in the distribution \( M \) in response to spatial inhomogeneities.
